# Independent EAL failure review — same hardware campaign

Scope: docs/source/private receipt inspection only. Reviewer performs no target or
product mutation. Current physical acceptance verdict: BLOCK pending a corrected
renderer/native artifact and actual guarded physical result. This is a real runtime
failure, not a deferred laboratory-only test.

Actual root-owned failure receipt f64ad15bd241d4bbed2e3219900b6836138dcaf13be17ce2f916df2bc9559de1
is18019B0600. Independent selected JSON assertions confirm no COMMITTED, rolled-back
marker present, no console/deadman marker; five distinct VPP starts failed EINVAL22.
Native log reports old configuration restored, VPP/management healthy at14:30:10
and locks released at14:30:11. The inactive/dead native unit Result=success reflects
successful rollback. Full private journal/config/network remain off Git.

Pinned [VPP parser](https://github.com/FDio/vpp/blob/c3200b88dc46bd380f00a49ca3392a102cc1980b/src/plugins/dpdk/device/init.c#L1303)
turns these clauses into incompatible EAL options. Its [DPDK build pin](https://github.com/FDio/vpp/blob/c3200b88dc46bd380f00a49ca3392a102cc1980b/build/external/packages/dpdk.mk#L24)
matches the independently read [DPDK conflict check](https://github.com/DPDK/dpdk/blob/v26.03/lib/eal/common/eal_common_options.c#L215)
and [Linux EINVAL path](https://github.com/DPDK/dpdk/blob/v26.03/lib/eal/linux/eal.c#L556).
This is a source-derived cause tied to the actual configuration and failure;
full live expanded EAL argv was not captured. No diagnostic VPP relaunch is required.

Appropriate narrow correction: when explicit physical dev rows exist, emit only
their closed allowlist; exclude protected management and blacklisted PCIs from
that allowlist through the existing rejecting model. Do not also emit literal
EAL blacklist clauses. With no physical dev rows, retain existing noPCI/blacklist
output unchanged. Canonical apply separately snapshots protected PCI identities
through management interface discovery; this must remain independent of rendered
blacklist syntax. Independent final product diff/regressions, full hosted quick,
corrected native helper identity and exact fresh render/dryrun precede any retry.

Root owns the isolated mandatory correction. Worker source diagnosis was published
at3363c2293510a907184b176e0d1ed44150faf690; reviewer independently used the primary
sources above and actual receipt, not just that worker conclusion. Current .211
VPP is rolled back to noPCI; buffers65536 remains stored but not enforced. Physical
enumeration/forwarding/reboot acceptance remains incomplete.
